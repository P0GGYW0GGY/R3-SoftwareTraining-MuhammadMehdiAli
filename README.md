This project used arduino on thinkercad to create a dual motor system that has 4 different modes, dependent on the dip switch as well as a speed dependent on the potentiometer
As I already have experience with arduino, specifically on thinkercad which was our school's preferred learning platform during quarantine the year before, more of the background knowledged required was already known. I also have experience with wiring such schematics on real breadboards which also aided in this project.
Wiring the schematic was simple for the most part, but there were roadblocks that I encountered along the way. I noticed the battery was not working as a source of power which I later realized was because the ground must be connected to the arduino. I also learned that when wiring the components to the L293D, each must be essentially reflected both on the x and y axis. This posed a slight issue during the output as one of the motors were receiving half of the RPM compared to the other which was due to improper wiring.
